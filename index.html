<h2>About Me:</h2>

<p>Hello! I am Joshua Dickens, a third year Computer Science major at the University of Cincinnati. I have a deep passion for video games and sports and have found multiple interests in the industry since I started studying it, such as web development, video game development, and analytics. I am currently attempting to develop a basic to intermediate understanding of every skill in each industry so I can prepare myself for any internship position in the industry that opens up.</p>

<p>In school and on the job, I am working hard to hone my skills in several programming languages, such as C, C++, Python, HTML, and more. I am focused and attentive to detail when addressing high-volume task loads to meet deadlines. I am inspired by making a positive impact by applying critical thinking skills and my problem-solving abilities allow me to address challenges to achieve results. </p>

<p>As for my personal life, I enjoy spending time with friends, family, and watching sports. I'm a huge Bengals<strong>(Who Dey!)</strong> and Cavs<strong>(Let em know!)</strong> fan and I have to admit I've been a little blessed with their performance over the course of my childhood and now minus when I first started watching them, but it would be nice to see each of them win another title with the teams they have now! Despite that I'd say my favorite pastime is playing video games, hence why I want to go into the industry. Some of my all time favorites from my childhood and now include Call of Duty (Especially Zombies), Halo, Elder Scrolls, Minecraft, Zelda (Especially Breath of the Wild), NBA2K, and many more. I also love cats and dogs and have a 5 year old German Shepard at home with my parents that you can see in my picture!</p>

<p>As for what I'm expecting out of this class, I'm hoping I can hone the skills to be a successful web developer and possibly pursue an internship and possibly later a full-time job in the industry! The more I've explored this field the more I've really came to enjoy it, and I'm looking forward to a fun semester of building this website! </p>
